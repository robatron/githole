# githole

A little project that attempts to be a less-restrictive and lighter-weight version of [Dropbox](http://www.dropbox.com/) utilizing built-in Linux tools, FOSS, and maybe a little bit of Python ;-)

## Requirements

I'm writing this for myself at the moment, so I'm only trying to get it to work on my machines which run Ubuntu Linux. I'm using completely open-source software and tools, so I'm sure you could get it working for your purposes too.

Feel free to contact me with any questions.
